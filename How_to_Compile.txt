Geno_Driver (5-9-16)
######################################################

Geno_Driver uses and links Eigen and Intel MKL numerical libraries.
Furthermore, the C++11 version needs to be on the computer in order to utilize
the random library.

######################################################
EIGEN is freely available at http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page

Once at the site you just need to download the latest stable release package 
and uncompress it. For example, the current downloaded package is called
"eigen-eigen-07105f7124f9.tar". In order to use it you just have to place it in the file
where all of the other Geno_Driver files are located and type the following command to uncompress

tar xvjf eigen-eigen-36bf2ceaf8f5.tar.bz2

This command will uncompress all the library files to a directory called
“eigen-eigen-07105f7124f9”, which then serves as your folder to path for any eigen function.

######################################################
Intel MKL is a commercial library and is at http://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-mkl
However, there is an opportunity to obtain the Intel MKL library (for Linux)
free of charge for non-commercial use at the following website
http://software.intel.com/en-us/non-commercial-software-development. 

The Intel MKL can sometimes be tricky to download and link, but there is a step-by-step
protocol within the folders that is downloaded or instruction can be obtained at  
“http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-mkl-103-install-guide” and depending on 
the computing system you are running, a guide to linking the Intel MKL libraries can 
be found at “https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-mkl-link-line-advisor”.

######################################################
The C++11 standards start being supported in gcc 4.7 or newer. You would install
or update to the correct version of gcc using the normal package manager or installer, 
depending on what type of OS you are using. Some website that can be used a reference
include:

https://gcc.gnu.org/projects/cxx-status.html#cxx11
https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-4.7/cxx0x_status.html

######################################################
Once both EIGEN, Intel MKL libraries and gcc version 4.4 or newer have been installed and
the folders placed in the directory where all of the Geno_Driver files are located the
last thing you have to do is change the path for EIGEN and Intel MKL libraries.

For lines 13 and 14 you need to change the path which aligns with where the files are located.

After changing the path all you need to do is type "make" and an executable file 
called "GenoDriver" will be created in your working directory.
