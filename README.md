# Geno-Diver
Geno-Diver is a complex animal genetic simulation tool that is able to simulate quantitative and/or fitness characters. 
It utilizes Intel MKL and Eigen libraries to perform matrix multiplication and is multi-threaded.

An updated version (V3) was uploaded on August 15, 2018 along with a website that provides multiple examples and snippets of R code. The website is at the following url: https://jeremyhoward.github.io/Geno_Diver_Website/.

The user manual and website contain all the necessary information to run and generate your own simulation scenarios.
